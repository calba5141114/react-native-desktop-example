# React Native Desktop on MacOS example

Just seeing what is and isn't possible with React Native on MacOS.
Looks pretty pleasing so far this is basic UI made in to look and feel like
a music player. Warning: RNOSX is glitchy and very early stage at the moment so I wouldn't use it
for a production app or anything.
